        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Sea level rise is a critical global issue, mainly caused by thermal expansion and the melting of ice. It impacts coastal regions worldwide and is a major consequence of climate change.</p>

        <div class="process">
            <h3>Thermal Expansion</h3>
            <p>As the global temperature rises, ocean water expands, contributing to rising sea levels. This process is called thermal expansion.</p>

            <h3>Melting Ice Sheets</h3>
            <p>As the Earth's temperature increases, glaciers and ice caps melt, releasing freshwater into the oceans and raising sea levels.</p>

        <h2>Negative Economic Impact of the Sea Level Rise in Shanghai</h2>
        <p>Shanghai is a low-lying coastal city, with an elevation of 4 meters. This makes the city more vulnerable to the sea level rise compared to other cities because it is closer to the sea level. There have been many floods in the past regarding this topic and this has caused many economical losses. Here are some examples of what the floods have caused:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2016 Floods
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2016, severe flooding in China, including Shanghai, resulted in economic losses of approximately $44.7 billion, making it one of the most expensive flooding sequences in history. <a href="https://forbes.com">(forbes.com)</a></li>

            <li>2018 Typhoon Rumbia
                <ul>
                    <li>Typhoon Rumbia, which affected Shanghai in 2018, caused economic losses estimated at Â¥36.91 billion (approximately $5.36 billion). <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">(wikipedia.org)</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>2023 Floods
                <ul>
                    <li>In 2023, floods in China, including Shanghai, led to economic losses exceeding $13.2 billion.  <a href="https://www.disasterphilanthropy.org">(disasterphilanthropy.org)</a></li>
                </ul>
            <li>2024 Floods
                <ul>
                    <li>In the first half of 2024, natural disasters, including floods, caused economic losses of 93.16 billion yuan (approximately $12.83 billion) in China. <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">(reuters.com)</a></li>
